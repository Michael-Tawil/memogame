# üéÆ Multi-Verse Memory Challenge

A sophisticated multi-round memory game that tests players across three beloved universes: Pokemon, Digimon, and Naruto. Built with modern React architecture and advanced state management to showcase professional frontend development skills.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced React patterns, complex state management, and multi-API integration through an engaging game experience. Players progress through three challenging rounds, each featuring characters from different universes, with escalating difficulty and a comprehensive lives system.

**The Challenge:** Click on different characters without repeating selections. Cards shuffle after each click, testing true memory rather than position recall. Complete all three rounds to achieve victory!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### **State Management Strategy**
```javascript
// Centralized game state with async actions
const useGameStore = create((set, get) => ({
  // Game progression
  currentRound: 1,
  attemptsLeft: 2,
  totalScore: 0,
  
  // Round management
  selectedCards: [],
  currentRoundCards: [],
  gameStatus: 'playing',
  
  // API data handling
  startNewRound: async (roundNumber) => {
    // Multi-API switching logic
  },
  
  // Game mechanics
  handleCardClick: (cardName) => {
    // Complex click logic with shuffle
  }
}))
```

### **Multi-API Integration**
- **Unified Data Structure**: Normalizes different API responses
- **Error Resilience**: Handles API failures gracefully  
- **Performance**: Optimized fetching strategies
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new character universes

### **Component Composition**
